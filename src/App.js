              </h3>
              <p className='left-content-metadata'>
                'KARYASHALA' is a noble endeavor of Government of India by Science and Engineering Board (SERB) under Accelerate Vigyan Scheme to improve research productivity of promising PG and PhD students from universities and colleges through high-end workshops on specific themes. This program aims to provide opportunities to acquire specialized research skills. These workshops will primarily be facilitated at organizations / institutions / laboratories of national importance. PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing Jamshedpur has decided to be a part of this unique initiative and share our Institutional resources with the society towards higher goals of national importance. Thus, the current workshop has come into being. This event is sponsored by SERB.

              </h3>
              <p className='left-content-metadata'>
                'KARYASHALA' is aimed to provide hands-on experience to the students primarily from universities, colleges, private academic institutions, and newly established institutes in handling/troubleshooting of high-end scientific instruments and such skill development on themes required for research work. The program is meant to support motivated PG and Ph.D. level students, who are having a strong willingness to get excellence in their scientific and engineering research pursuits in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics &Proteomics. The objective of the course is to examine current issues in Mathematical Biology, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from an engineering perspective. A major goal of this course is to introduce students studying Biology or Biochemistry to the concepts and analytical techniques of engineering. Likewise, engineers will be exposed to the terminology and concepts of Molecular Biology, Genomics and Proteomics. Students, faculty and researchers in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Bioinformatics, Biology, and Biochemistry will be the targeted participants.
